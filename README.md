# Resources for Online / Hybrid Teaching and Learning

This repo hosts some online / hybrid teaching and learning materials I've created given my few years of sharing courses on the [Liberal Arts Collaborative for Digital Innovation](https://lacol.net/) platform.

1. [A short video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MclwbW7zv7o&list=PL_lWxa4iVNt2-cuyCUqaAEFNdmz1bcRZt) at LACOL 2018 meeting, about the course mechanics of sharing Vassar's MATH 347 across campuses.

2. A set of slides I used at the Blended Learning in the Liberal Arts 2019 at Bryn Mawr College, on how to use Zoom for online/hybrid courses: Workshop_MonikaHu.pdf.

3. A set of 37 short videos on undergraduate-level Probability:
    1. MATH 241 Probability taught in Fall 2019 at Vassar College, NY.

    3. Coverage: main topics from Chapter 1 to Chapter 7.
